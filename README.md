# iwedb
The international wind energy database (iwedb) is an open source database for wind energy related issues. Users can store information about wind energy projects around the world and make them publicly available for everyone.

It is programmed using the django framework.

Since I am a total beginner it has a lot of flaws. If you are interested in helping me out, don't hesitate to contact me. My aim is to bring this website online with your help.

You can see the result on http://iwedb.tk ! Have a look and feel free to contribute.
