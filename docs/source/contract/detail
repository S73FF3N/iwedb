Contract Detail
===============

The detail view of a contract lists all properties of a contract. Under the contract name the scope of service is summarised. If it is a full maintenance (with/without large components), Basic (+) or remote
control, will be set in the value of the individual scope of services. The contract dokument can be openned over thy icon at the upper right side.

The individual scope of service are clustered in the four categories remote control, sheduled maintenance, suppression and main components. The green tick or the read "x" will show if a scope of service is
integrated or not. So services with a green tick are included and those with a red "x" not. The same apply for optional services, which are listd at the bottom.

For each contract the possibility exist to crate individual commentaries and add dokuments to them. This possibility should also be used for demands, if there is no additional contract object.

Contracts can be terminated with the button "Terminate". After using the button a Formula appears, where the termination reason and date have to be enterred. Terminated contracts will be transferred from
"Contract List" into "Terminated Contract".
