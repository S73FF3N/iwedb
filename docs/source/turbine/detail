Turbine Detail
==============

The map view in the detail view shows the geographical position of the WEA. If no coordinates are available, the map view is not displayed.

The other properties are listed tabular. The year of Commisioning / Dismanting is presented on a timeline.

Analogical to the wind farm, linked (Pool)projects, contracts and expert reports are listed.

A particularity is the formula "Dublicate Turbine" at the top side of the detail view. With the formula turbines can be dublicated, which makes the creation of big wind farms whith WEA with the same
technology easier.
