Turbine Form
============

When creating or editing turbines, conventions have to be obsered, which are explained with the following questions.

The turbine ID is an explict mark of a wind turbine. Its builded out of the manufacturer shorting and the serial number.

The following field are just displayed, if the state of the turbine was set on "dismantled": Dismantlich(Year), Dismantling(Month), Dismantlich(Day), Repowered, Subsequent Turbine

What are the shortings of the manufacturers for the "Turbine ID"?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    *   Senvion: SEN, For excample: SEN300345

What is the procedure, if the Turbine ID is not availabel?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a turbine ID is not available, the following shema have to be used to name the turbine: <Wind farm Name><WEA-Number>

Fro Excample: Windpark Musterstadt mit 3 WEA
            Erste WEA: "Musterstadt01"
            Zweite WEA: "Musterstadt02"
            Dritte WEA: "Musterstadt03"

Its neccasary to always pay attetntion to leave no space between the WEA-Name and the WEA-Number. Also bfore singe-digit numbers a 0 have to be added.

How geographical coordinates can be determinded with the help of Openstreetmap and what means "Openstreetmap ID"(OSM ID)?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Openstreetmap (OSM) is an Open-Source_Project for the collection and presentation of cartographical data. It´s available over https://www.openstreetmap.org/.

Many of the excisting wind turbines are mapped in Openstreetmap. They appear on the map in form of a WEA-Symbol if the zoom is big enough. One click on that symbol opens a dialogue. Here the field
"Objektanfrage" have to be valued. After this some objects are listed at the left side of the window. Under "Ähnliche Eigenschaften" a knot appears under the objects, which displays the wind turbine.
One click on this knot opens all information to this WEA, as well the coordinates. Every knot in OSM has a own OSM ID. This ID can be found in the headding of the knot. Either the headding just contains
the OSM ID or the OSM ID stands in brackets behind the headding.

How turbines with the same properties can be dublicated?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the top line of the detail view of a turbine the formula "Duplicate Turbine" exist. This serves for the duplication of many turbines with the same properties.

In the formula field just the number of dublicatet tubines habe to be entered. If a wind farm contains 6 WEA from the same type, the number "5" have to be entered, to dublicate the first WEA 5 times. Now
all information from the first Turbine are contained into the 5 others without the geographical information and the tubine ID.

Condition fro the dplication of a turbine is the correct procurement of the Turbin ID. This always have to enf on two numbers. The area before this two numbers is the trunk of the Turbine ID. If a Turbine
got duplicated, this two numbers get extracted and with a interation constantly generate new Turbine ID´s.

If the number of turbines got entered in the formula, the correctness of the turbine ID is controlled with "Duplicate turbine". If no error was detected, an other button ("Go") appears, which is used to
finish the duplucation. If a turbine of the WEA dont end on two numbers, the error report "Turbine could not be duplicated due to invalid turbine name" adppears.

After finishing the duplication, the user get transmitted to the detail view of the wind farm. Here the generated turbines arise.

One WEA can be maximal duplicated 99 times. If a wind farm be composed of more than 100 identical WEA, the following proceed is needed:

    1. The WEA got created with a Turbine ID, based on the following sample: "Windpark001"
    2. This WEA got duplicated 98 times. The Turnines "Windpark002" to "Windpark099" are created.
    3. After this the WEA "Windfarm100" have to be created manually.
    4. This WEA can be duplicated as required.
