Project List
============

The project list shows all projects, beginning with the last modified project. The filter state is basically set like just actually negotiated projects are listed. Won or lost projects are not displayed,
but its possible to show them over changing the filter options.

Over the use of the following filter, the selection of projects can be enclosed:

    *   Project Name: Name of the project
    *   DWT: Unity of the Deutsche Windtechnik; Multiple selection possible
    *   State: State of the project progress; Multiple selection possible
