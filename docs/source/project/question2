In which case a project is "lost", in which it is "canceled"?
=============================================================

The state of a project have to be "lost", if a competitor got the project.

The state of a project have to be "canceled", if no one got the project because of reasons (tender cancelled, WEA repowered, no award in the EEG-Tendering procedure, etc.)
