Offer Number
============

The offer number is a clear combination of numbers and letters. It enables the clear allocation of offers and projects.

Offer numbers just can be crated and not changed. Because of this their uniqueness is ensured.

The formula "New Offer Number" in the Projects-Menu helps to crate new offer numbers in the case, that not all necessary information like Actor, Wind Farm and Turbine(s) are available at the time of necessity
of the offer number. The formula helps to crate information, which are usefull to assign the offer number to a project later. Beside the Windpark as free text, the number of WEA, the technology and the
sales manager, its possible to add more information as free text. These information have no connection to the data base. Only a link with a project creates this connection.

Basic prerequisite for the generating of an offer number is the value of a DWT-Unit. Depending on the unit the offer number starts with different letters. The following shortings are connected to the
individual units:

    *   DWTS: A
    *   DWTX: X
    *   DWTOC: O
    *   DWTUS: U
    *   DWTUK: B
    *   DWTSARL: F
    *   DWTDK: D
    *   DWTSW: S
    *   DWTPO: P
    *   DWTES: E
    *   DWTNED: N

For every unit a continous offer number exist. The offer numbers continue over turn of the year, until 9999 is reached. The following offer number starts with 0000 again. Therefore every unit has 10.000
offer numbers per year.

The alternative of creating an offer number, take place over the project formula. If here a DWT-Unit get valued and the button "Generate Offer Number" get activated, an offer number gets created in the data
base. All optional fields (Wind Farm, Number, Technology, Sales Manager and free text) stay free in this object.

All generated offer numbers are listed in the "Offer Number List".
