When a new wind farm has to get add, when just amend a current?
===============================================================

The convention is: If wind turbines geograpfical form a unit, what means that there is no much space and no communal borders between them, just one wind farm have to get added.

This is independet from the used tecnology of the turbines.

If mor wind turbines are located in one commune, but there is much space between them, its neccesary to crate a new wind farm for every turbine. For excample:
Musterstadt-Nord and Musterstadt-SÃ¼d or Musterstadt-Stadtteil A and Musterstadt-Stadtteil B.
