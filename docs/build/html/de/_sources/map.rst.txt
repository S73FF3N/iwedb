Map
===

The "Map" is used to visualize geographical items on a object-overarching Map.
On the map itÂ´s possible to display the following items: "Turbines", "Service"
"Locations", "Projects" and "Contracts". For this the selection list above the
map is used.

The orange WEA-Symbols stands for one turbine. With one klick on it, the
technology and the turbine ID going to be displayed. The turbine ID works as a
link to the detail view from the turbine.

Projects are displayed as a green site symbol, contracts with a black WEA-Symbol
and service stations with a white "x".

Also the units can be selected which will display relevant information. The link
from the openend window always leads to the detail view from the unit.
