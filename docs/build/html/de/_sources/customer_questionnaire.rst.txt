Custommer Questionnaire Formula
-------------------------------

At the start page of the questionnaire, the custommer has to enter some personal data.
He has the possibility to change the language between german and english at the upper right
corner.
The custommer have the possibility to save his inputs for later. Herefore he dont
have to press any button. He also can jump to the first and previous page of the
questionnaire.
Every field with "*" has to be filled by the custommer. After all required fields are
filled, the next page can be openend. Every field has a small help text below, which helps filling
the gaps correctly. Depending on the inputs the custommer is doing, the available fields in the cuestionnaire change.
For excample if the custommer enter 2 in "Amount of turbines" on the second page,
There are also just 2 available fields to use in the section "Turbine IDs and
Commissioning Dates".
After all inputs are done a realistic contract start gets calculated, based
on the contract start the custommer want and the completeness of the base data.
