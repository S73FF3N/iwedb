Turbine Model Detail
====================

The detail view is structured into the hadding, which shows the manufacturer and the type, the main part with pictures and all usable information and the map view.
At the right of the hadding its possible eddit the information with the "Edit"-Button. As well its possible to add images with the "Add Image"-Button.
In the main part all links and pictures of the technolgy are shown and on the right all properties which are filled.

Above the map view the number of Technologies from this technology in the database are displayed. If the coordinates are available they are also in the map view. Also the number of turbines, which have a
contract with the Deutschen Windtechnik, are displayed in the next row. With a click on the plus-symbol on the right, the row expands. Now all turbines under contract are listed. They are linked to each
detail view.

The map shows all real turbines, which are saved in the database. This is an example for the relational link of the data in the database.

In each detail view the history of editing of the object is shown at the bottom. This makes the edits of each user transperent. Normally the edit history is folded. With a click on the row it can get
folded out.
