Project List
------------

The project list shows all projects, beginning with the last modified project. The filter state is basically set like just actually negotiated projects are listed. Won or lost projects are not displayed,
but its possible to show them over changing the filter options.

Over the use of the following filter, the selection of projects can be enclosed:

    *   Project Name: Name of the project
    *   DWT: Unity of the Deutsche Windtechnik; Multiple selection possible
    *   State: State of the project progress; Multiple selection possible
    *   Probability: Probability of conclusion of a contract in percent; Range filter (from - to)
    *   Scope: Scope of service of the potential contract; Multiple selection possible
    *   Manufacturer: Manfufacturer of the WEA; Multiople selection possible 
    *   Model: Technology (Turbine Model) of the WEA; Multiple selection possible
    *   Negotiation Partner: Multiple selection possible
    *   Contract signature: Period of the contract siganture; Range filter (from - to); Format: yyyy-mm-dd
    *   Commencement Date: Date of contract start; Range filter (from - to); Format: yyyy-mm-dd
    *   Requets Date: Period of the first contact; Range filter (form - to); Format: yyyy-mm-dd
    *   Contract: Type of conclusion of contract (Nex contract, Extension etc.); Multiple selection possible
    *   Offer Number
    *   Sales Manager: Responsible sales employee; Multiple selection possible
    *   Country: Multiple selection possible

If the "Customer Information Sheet" or "Windfarm Information Sheet" is not deposited 30 days before potention contract start (state "Negotiation"/"Final Negotiation"/"Won"), thr corresponding line will color 
read, to point the user to less information before contract start.

Analog to the "Turbine List" also for projects diagrams are available, which give a fast grafical overview over the distribution of the properties from the filtered projects. The followinf five properties 
are displayed as pie or bar charts: Project state, Scope of Service, Technology, Negotiation Partner and age of the WAE at contract start (bar chart).

Custom Export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The button "Custom Export" exports based on the actual filter value, the project list in Excel-Fomat. Through this a processing is possible.

Project Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the button "Project Overview" also the project list exports into Excel-Format. The filters are not applied here. This export is oriented on the format from "Projektübersicht DWT Group" in the drive 
"dwt international"

Project Detail
--------------

Beside the information listed directly in the formula, other project specific information are generated with funktions. They are listed in the detail view of the project. Among others the maximal age of
the turbine will be calculated. Also for every manufacturer from a wind enegy plant a technology manager get deposited in the system. This is a sales employee, who maintain all projects of one technology.
Also the operator of the turbine of the project is listed. Based on the annual charge per wind enegy plant, the annual and total compensation of the potential contract will be calculated.

If the project is a member of a primary pool project, this Information will be elucidated under the project name with "part of:" and a ling to the pool project.

To every project the files "Customer Information Sheet" and "Wind Famr Information Sheet" can be added now. These are annexes at the DWTX/SARL.

The button "Coordinates" allwos the export of coordinates from turbines linked to the project.

With the service bases which are deposited in the system, the to the project location closest service base, which is a member of the responsible unit and also matches technological, will be calculated over
a funktion. The linear distance will be given. Also a link to Google Maps is available, which shows the actual distance and the driving time between project location and service base.

The values for distance and driving time, which are provided by Google Maps, can now be used to provide the travelling expense at basic contracts over the formula "Driving Rate". The deposited formula
is based on 0,44 €/km travel costs and 37 €/h personnel costs. After using the "Calculate"-Button, the flat rates for weekdays, saturday, sundays and feast days will be calculated.

Another formula enables to show completed contracts in a radius from x kilometers around the project location. Therefor the wnated number of kilometers have to be entered in the formula and. After this the 
Calculate-Button must be pressed. After a short calculation time under the formula all contracts are listed, which are located in the valued radius.

Analog to this a formula exist, which shows all windparks in the database, whos´s WEA from a certain manufacturer in a certain radius around the project location show.

If reports are neccessary befor contract start, these are displayed tabular under "Expert Reports before operational commencement". Here every row shows one date per WEA.The coloured marking of a line
symbolized depending on the state and the planning date, if action is needed. Individual dates can be modified or deleted over the buttons "Ändern"/"Löschen".

To add Information from actual projects, a commentary function exist. With the button "Add Comment", the formula for creating a new comment is reachable. A comment is composed out of a text and optional a
attached file. Written comments are listed sloping by their creating or changing date. The crating date and the author of the comment are shown beside the text. The SHift-Symbol at the right can be used to 
edit the coment. If a new file was added, a Dokument-Symbol appears, which can be used to open the file. Commentaries from primary Pool Projects are adopted under the heading "Pool Project Comments"
automatic.

Project to Contract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a project owns the state "Won", the button "Contract" appears at the upper right area from the detail view. It is used to transferring a project in a contract. The contract formula will open, which
assume the DWT unit, the turbines and the contracts start and final date from the project.

Create Initiation Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a project owns the state "Won", the button "Initiation" appears at the upper right area from the detail view. With this button a PDF-Document will be created. It will make the maintenance of the project
information in other systems easiers. Already existing information from the project are used to fill specific fields in this formula. 

Project Form
------------

In the project formula the characteristic propertieas of a project are determined. The help texts under each field help to fill in the information correctly.

By giving the information of the DWT unti, it´s important to value the technological responsible unit, not inevitable the unot from the sales manager. The sales manager got determined initial. A changing
of the sales manager is just possible over the responsible unit or the adminitrators.

The state "Potential" says, that no customer contact happened until now. On "Coffee" already a non-binding contact took place. "Soft Offer" discribes a indicative, not binding offer, while "Hard Offer" a
binding offer shows. If you are in (final) negotiations, the state is "(final) Negotiation". Not successful projects are "Lost" or "Cancelled", won projects are "Won". The "Probability" depents on the
assesment from the sales manager.

If the state is "Won" or "Lost", also the field "Awarding Reason" appears in the formula. Here a reason why the project got won or lost can be added.

If a offer number is necessary and it is not already generated over "New Offer Number", it gets generated over the button "Generate Offer Number". Instead of the button the new offer number now appears.
This have to be assume in the formula field "Offer Number". If a offer number already exist, it`s not necessary to use the button "Generate Offer Number" and the existing one have to be valued in the 
field "Offer Number".

For the value of the turbines the fiels "Windfarm" exist. If a wind park is indicated, the value in the field "Turbines" get reduced to the turbines of the wind park. Also the field "All turbine of 
selected wind farm?" appears. If all turbines of the wind park have to be linked, its possible to set the tick here. This spares the value of all turbines in the fiels "Turbines". With setting of the 
tick the field "Turbines" dissapars.

The fields "Contract" and "Contract Type" have to be treated the following way: Under "Contract" its possible to indicate, if a contract to the wind farm already exist ("Extension", "Upgrade" or "Downgrade")
or if it is a new contract ("New Contract"). "Extension" discribes a contract extension without a changing scope of service. "Upgrade" and "Downgrade" also discribe a contract extension, but with a scope
of service. "Contract Type" define the scope of service. Beside the known contract types ("Basic", "Full Maintance without M(ain) C(omponents)", "Full maintance with MC"), it´s possible to value isolated
scopes like "Remote Control", "Spare Parts" and "Technical Operations". If no of these options is applicable, "Other" have to be valued.

The field "Contract Signature" just gets listed in the formula, if the state is "Won".

The section "Expert report before operational commencement" checs, if a expert report is necessary before contract start. If the checkbox under "Is an expert report before the operational commencement
necessary?" gets activated, 3 other checkboxes appear. Here it`s possibel to value the type of expert report. For every valued expert report, a capital expert report (one single appointment) gets 
created, for every turbine linked in the project.

Reminder
--------

Reminder are serving for memory, which is send by mail. The button "Add Reminder" leads to a formula, which define the reminder. The date sets the day, where the reminder get send. The recipient is the 
person who reseaves the mail. At least a text can be defined, whcih builds the content of the reminder. At the valued date the recipient gets a mail at 6 AM with the text of the reminder. If a reminder
was set, a bell jar icon appears at the top, right site of the detail view from the project.

Pool Project
------------

A pool project is the merger of more than one projects. It serves for the caring of projects, which consists of many individual projects. Examples for this are tenders, wich contains variety wind parks,
or projects, which deal with the overall portfolio of one asset manager or of one energy supplier.

    *   **Name**: Indication of the project; For excample: Hemme Weißes Moor
    *   **Sales Manager**: Sales employee, who serves the pool project; For excample: Jörg Fuchs
    *   **Projects**: Projects, which are involved in the pool project; For excample: Buchhainer Heide, La Haie-Oisseau and Skogaby
    *   **Negotiation Partner**: Companies, the project got negotiated with; For excample: Allian Global Investors GmbH
    *   Contact Person: Contact person of the negotiation partner; For excample: Jacqueline Huynh
    *   Request Date: Time of the first contact as date; For excample: 2019-01-17

Pool Project List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the pool project list all pool projects are listed tabular. With the use of the following filter the value can be limited:

    *   Name: Name of the pool project
    *   Projects: Name of the projects, the pool project contains; Multiple selection possible
    *   Negotiational Partner: Multiple selection possible
    *   Request Date: Time of the first contact; Range filter (from - to); Format: yyy-mm-dd
    *   Sales Manager: Responsible sales manager; Multiple selection possible

Pool Project Detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the detail view of a pool project linked projects are listed tabular. Therefore individual projects are fast evident. The last actualised project is listed in the upper part of the table.

Commetns of a pool project affect to the idividual projects too. They going to be added in the detail view of individual projects.

Pool Project Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Analogue to the project formula the sales manager of a project pool just can be changed by the sales manager and the administrators.

Offer Number
------------

The offer number is a clear combination of numbers and letters. It enables the clear allocation of offers and projects.

Offer numbers just can be crated and not changed. Because of this their uniqueness is ensured.

The formula "New Offer Number" in the Projects-Menu helps to crate new offer numbers in the case, that not all necessary information like Actor, Wind Farm and Turbine(s) are available at the time of necessity
of the offer number. The formula helps to crate information, which are usefull to assign the offer number to a project later. Beside the Windpark as free text, the number of WEA, the technology and the
sales manager, its possible to add more information as free text. These information have no connection to the data base. Only a link with a project creates this connection. 

Basic prerequisite for the generating of an offer number is the value of a DWT-Unit. Depending on the unit the offer number starts with different letters. The following shortings are connected to the 
individual units:

    *   DWTS: A
    *   DWTX: X
    *   DWTOC: O
    *   DWTUS: U
    *   DWTUK: B
    *   DWTSARL: F
    *   DWTDK: D
    *   DWTSW: S
    *   DWTPO: P
    *   DWTES: E
    *   DWTNED: N

For every unit a continous offer number exist. The offer numbers continue over turn of the year, until 9999 is reached. The following offer number starts with 0000 again. Therefore every unit has 10.000
offer numbers per year. 

The alternative of creating an offer number, take place over the project formula. If here a DWT-Unit get valued and the button "Generate Offer Number" get activated, an offer number gets created in the data 
base. All optional fields (Wind Farm, Number, Technology, Sales Manager and free text) stay free in this object.

All generated offer numbers are listed in the "Offer Number List".

How to deal with projects, which contains many wind farms and also get negotiate together?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Projects, which contain more than one wind farm and get negotiated together fist, have to be created as a project first. An excample could be a purchasing group.

The advantage here is, that fist just one project needs care (Commentaries, etc.).

As soon as the individual wind farms of the project are negotiated, its necessary to crate a individual project. Here now individual start dsates, compensations, etc. can be tracked. The in the primary
project containing turbines which affect the individual project can be deleted now. 

As soon as all individual projects of the primary projects are negotiated, the primary projact can be deleted. Which offer numbers existing and if these are already linked to the project will be listed tabular
here. The filters make the search for specific offer numbers easier.

In which case a project is "lost", in which it is "canceled"?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The state of a project have to be "lost", if a competitor got the project. 

The state of a project have to be "canceled", if no one got the project because of reasons (tender cancelled, WEA repowered, no award in the EEG-Tendering procedure, etc.)
