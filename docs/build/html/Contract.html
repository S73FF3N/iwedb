<div class="section" id="terminated-contracts">
<h2>Terminated Contracts<a class="headerlink" href="#terminated-contracts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beside the “Contract List” an analog contract list exist, which contains the terminated or expired contracts.</p>
<p>Terminated contracts have the special feature, that the reference “Terminated” shows up before contract start. Also the termination date and the termination reason is indicated in the detail view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contract-detail">
<h2>Contract Detail<a class="headerlink" href="#contract-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The detail view of a contract lists all properties of a contract. Under the contract name the scope of service is summarised. If it is a full maintenance (with/without large components), Basic (+) or remote
control, will be set in the value of the individual scope of services. The contract dokument can be openned over thy icon at the upper right side.</p>
<p>The individual scope of service are clustered in the four categories remote control, sheduled maintenance, suppression and main components. The green tick or the read “x” will show if a scope of service is
integrated or not. So services with a green tick are included and those with a red “x” not. The same apply for optional services, which are listd at the bottom.</p>
<p>For each contract the possibility exist to crate individual commentaries and add dokuments to them. This possibility should also be used for demands, if there is no additional contract object.</p>
<p>Contracts can be terminated with the button “Terminate”. After using the button a Formula appears, where the termination reason and date have to be enterred. Terminated contracts will be transferred from
“Contract List” into “Terminated Contract”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contract-form">
<h2>Contract Form<a class="headerlink" href="#contract-form" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beside the general properties like names, DWT unit, Contractual partner and start- or enddate of the contract, the individual services and options are listed in the contract formula. A service is
included to a contract, if the accordingly box in the formula is filled. The formula field “Exclusions” defines the components, wich are included in the contract. Here a multiple selection is possible.</p>
<p>For the value of the turbines the help field “Winfarm” exist. If a windfarm is indicated, the vlaue of turbines in the fiels “Turbines” will be redused to the turbines of the valued winfarm. Also the
field “All turbines of selected wind farm?” will appear. If all turbines of the wind farm should be valued, the tick have to be set here. This saves the work from setting all ticks behind any turbine.
With setting the tick the field “Turbines” disappears.</p>
